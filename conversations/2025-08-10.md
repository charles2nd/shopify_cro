# Shopify CRO Copilot - Strategic Analysis Session
**Date:** August 10, 2025

## Session Overview
Initial strategic planning session for building a Shopify CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) audit tool. The user requested analysis of comprehensive requirements and a practical implementation strategy for solo development.

## Key Documents Analyzed
- `init.md` - Complete requirements specification for Shopify CRO Copilot
- Core vision: Automated CRO audits with actionable recommendations and copy-paste code snippets

## Strategic Analysis Provided

### Problem Identification
- Original requirements represent 6+ months of solo development work
- High complexity with advanced features (RAG, workspaces, scheduled crawls, PDF exports)
- Risk of over-engineering before proving core value

### Recommended Solution: Drastically Simplified MVP

**Scope Reduction:**
- Cut from 6+ months → 4-6 weeks development time
- Focus on core value proposition: audit → findings → actionable recommendations
- Eliminate complex features initially (workspaces, RAG, automation, exports)

**Simplified Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 (App Router) on Vercel
- Neon Postgres + Prisma ORM  
- Clerk for authentication
- Playwright for web crawling
- OpenAI API for LLM recommendations
- Manual-first approach to avoid over-automation

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Core Foundation**
- Basic Next.js setup with Clerk auth
- Simple Prisma schema (sites, crawls, pages, findings)
- Manual audit trigger via form input
- Basic Playwright crawler for key pages

**Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Analysis Engine**
- Implement 5-7 core heuristic rules
- Page classification logic
- Basic scoring system
- Simple findings display

**Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): LLM Integration**
- OpenAI integration for recommendations
- Generate copy variants and code snippets
- Basic report UI with copy-to-clipboard
- Manual export (copy/paste text)

### Key Strategic Recommendations
1. **Validate Early:** Get real Shopify store audits working ASAP
2. **Manual First:** Avoid complex automation until core value is proven
3. **Focus on Output Quality:** Great recommendations > feature completeness
4. **Iterate Based on Usage:** Let real usage drive feature priorities

## Core Goal Clarification
Help Shopify store owners increase conversion rates by providing:
- Automated technical audits of their storefront
- Prioritized improvement recommendations  
- Ready-to-use copy variants and code snippets
- Clear "where to paste" instructions for developers

## Current Status
- Strategic analysis completed ✅
- Goal clarification provided ✅  
- User setting up TDD environment with agents
- Ready for implementation phase

## Next Steps (When Ready)
1. Initialize Next.js project with recommended tech stack
2. Set up basic database schema with Prisma
3. Implement simple crawler for homepage analysis
4. Build first heuristic rule (e.g., CTA presence detection)
5. Create basic UI for viewing audit results

## Technical Architecture (Simplified MVP)
```
Input: Shopify store URL
↓
Playwright crawler → Extract key metrics
↓  
Heuristic rules → Generate findings
↓
OpenAI API → Create recommendations + snippets
↓
Simple UI → Display prioritized actionable report
```

## Resource Requirements (MVP)
- Development: 4-6 weeks solo
- Monthly costs: ~$50-100 (Vercel Pro, Neon, OpenAI API)
- No complex infrastructure or background jobs initially
